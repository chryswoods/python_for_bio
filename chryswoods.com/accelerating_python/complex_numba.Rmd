# Limitations of numba

When `numba` works, it works really well and is very easy to use.

However, the type of code that `numba` can accelerate is very limited.
It works well when working directly with numeric data within simple loops,
but struggles as soon as you are calling functions or interacting with
Python objects. This is because `numba` cannot get around the problem
in Python, that every function call or object method call is indirect,
and involves interacting with the Python Virtual Machine.

For example, let's add a progress bar
to our square root function;

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import math
import numpy as np
import numba
import tqdm

@numba.jit()
def calculate_roots(numbers):
    num_vals = len(numbers)
    result = np.zeros(num_vals, "f")

    for i in tqdm.tqdm(range(0, num_vals)):
        result[i] = math.sqrt(numbers[i])

    return result

numbers = np.random.rand(10000000)
result = calculate_roots(numbers)
```

```

```

(4.4 million square roots per second)

Timing this shows that it is much slower;

```{python, eval=FALSE}
timeit(calculate_roots(numbers))
```

```

2.45 s ± 47.9 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

This is about 800 times slower than the serial `numba` code.
You may also have, like me, seen lots of warnings printed to the screen;

```
  warnings.warn(errors.NumbaWarning(warn_msg,
/path/to/python3.8/site-packages/numba/core/object_mode_passes.py:161: NumbaDeprecationWarning:
Fall-back from the nopython compilation path to the object mode compilation path has been detected, this is deprecated behaviour.

For more information visit https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/deprecation.html#deprecation-of-object-mode-fall-back-behaviour-when-using-jit

```

We get this warning because the `tqdm` progress bar is a normal Python object.
`numba` does not work well with standard
Python objects, which includes Python containers like lists or dictionaries.
The function to be accelerated has to operate on only simple types
(e.g. numbers like floats or integers), and data has to be held
in arrays, such as a `numpy` array. The reason is that accessing
any function on a Python object means calling the a Python function that
is external to the `@numba.jit()` function that you are accelerating.
This means moving out of your `numba`-compiled code, and back into Python
code that is executed on the Python virtual machine.

You may ask how `len` and `math.sqrt` calls work, as these are also function calls?
In these cases, `numba` has some special code that recognises that
`math.sqrt` is really just a call to a built-in square root function,
and so it replaces the Python `math.sqrt` with a built-in pre-compiled square root.
It also recognises that `len` is simply looking up the size of the array,
so it does that directly.

These kind of transformations mean that `numba` will only accelerate
code where data is held in arrays (e.g. `numpy` arrays) and where
the operations performed on that data can be mapped to standard
operations (e.g. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) or built-in functions provided
by `numba`.

(you can see a [full list of supported Python features here](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/reference/pysupported.html))

In particular, the developers of `numba` have focussed on accelerating
Python code that uses `numpy`. As such, using `numpy` is recommended,
with lots of `numpy` functionality being available to be accelerated
via `numba`.

(you can see a [full list of supported numpy features here](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/reference/numpysupported.html))

At the time of writing, `numba` does not support `pandas`. This means
that it can be difficult to use `numba` to accelerate scripts that
make heavy use of `pandas`.

[see here for a more detailed answer to the pandas question](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/5minguide.html?highlight=pandas#will-numba-work-for-my-code)

# nopython mode

Printing a warning is helpful, but there are many times when you would
prefer that the script should fail if it can't be accelerated.
Accelerated scripts run thousands of times faster than non-accelerated
scripts. This means that if the accelerated script take seconds, the
non-accelerated script would take hours (there are 3600 seconds per hour).
In this case, it is better that a script exits quickly with an error,
than wastes hours of compute time running non-accelerated.

You can tell `numba` to exit if it is unable to fully accelerate a function.
You do this by adding `nopython=True` to the decorator, e.g.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import math
import numpy as np
import numba
import tqdm

@numba.jit(nopython=True)
def calculate_roots(numbers):
    num_vals = len(numbers)
    result = np.zeros(num_vals, "f")

    for i in tqdm.tqdm(range(0, num_vals)):
        result[i] = math.sqrt(numbers[i])

    return result

numbers = np.random.rand(10000000)
result = calculate_roots(numbers)
```

```

# Factoring out `numba`-supported code into functions

There are times where we do need to mix acceleratable and
non-acceleratable code. For example, how could we accelerate our
square-root code while keeping the progress bar?

In general, you do this by factoring out the `numba`-only part into
a "worker" function, which is only called by an outer-function.

For example, here we factor out the loop into a
`numba`-only part, which is called by an outer loop, which is connected
to the progress bar.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
@numba.jit(nopython=True, parallel=True)
def inner_calculate_roots(numbers, result, start, end):
    for i in numba.prange(start, end):
        result[i] = math.sqrt(numbers[i])


def calculate_roots(numbers):
    num_vals = len(numbers)
    result = np.zeros(num_vals, "f")
    nblocks = 10
    num_per_block = int(num_vals / nblocks)

    while nblocks*num_per_block < num_vals:
        num_per_block += 1

    for i in tqdm.tqdm(range(0, nblocks), unit_scale=num_per_block):
        start = i * num_per_block
        end = min(num_vals, (i+1)*num_per_block)
        inner_calculate_roots(numbers, result, start, end)

    return result

numbers = np.random.rand(10000000)
result = calculate_roots(numbers)
```

```

```

(1.6 billion(!) square roots per second)

```{python, eval=FALSE}
timeit(calculate_roots(numbers))
```

```
10.1 ms ± 93.1 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

Chunking up the loop into blocks has enabled us to get the speed of
`numba`, while also retaining useful Python code, such as using a progress
bar. It has also allowed us to parallelise the loop with `numba.prange`,
while still retaining a progress bar with `tqdm.tqdm`.

This is useful, as progress bars provide a great tool for embedding
the timing of your code into your script. Here, we can see that
`numba` has accelerated this code from ~4.4 million iterations per second
to ~1.6 billion iterations per second.

# Conclusion

`numba` is extremely poweful and very simple to use when it works.
You have to be careful to place everything into arrays, and be
mindful of which code is numeric (e.g. operations and functions
called on numeric data held in `numpy` arrays), and which
code is Python object code. You have to do the work to separate
Python object code and numeric code into, ideally, separate functions,
and then add `@numba.jit(nopython=True, cache=True)` decorators
to the numeric functions.

You can parallelise your `numba` code by adding `parallel=True` and
switching to `numba.prange` for the loops that you want to run in
parallel. If you have time, you can check out
this [bonus material](numba_bonus.html) that shows you how to best
optimise parallel `numba` code.

Finally, `numba` has [excellent documentation](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/index.html).
We highly recommend that you read through this if you want to learn
more about its features, e.g. how to call external C functions,
how to automatically vectorise functions, and how to compile
functions that will run on a GPU.

`numba` is an excellent tool, and a great first step in accelerating
your Python scripts. It is truly amazing that, when it works,
a simple `@numba.jit()` decorator can accelerate your script by
thousands of times, thereby saving you time, and saving significant
amounts of energy.

# Bonus Exercise

Add a `tqdm` progress bar to the `calculate_scores` function in
`slow.py`.

* How many rows per second are processed?

* Comment out the `@numba.jit(...)` line in your script and rerun.
  How many rows per second are processed? How much faster has
  `numba` made your script?
