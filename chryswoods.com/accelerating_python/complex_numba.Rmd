# Too good to be true?

When `numba` works, it is extremely powerful and easy to use.

However, `numba` does not work easily for all types of code. It is,
unfortunately, not as simple as adding `@numba.jit()` to all of the
functions in your code.

# Limitations of numba

What can't you accelerate.


# nopython=True

Preventing moving to and from Python. Errors raised on compile.


# Factoring out loops into functions

Show how to factor out loops. Maybe show `tqdm` here, as we factor out
blocks of loops, but still show a progress bar?
